# 🧱 Architect Annotation

## Technical Notes
- DB tables touched: `atcs` (INSERT new row), `atc*steps` (bulk INSERT copying source rows), `atc*assertions` (bulk INSERT copying source rows). All within one transaction.
- API surface: `POST /atcs/{source*id}/duplicate` with optional `{ new*title }` body. Returns 201 `{ atc_id }`. Returns 403 on insufficient role, 422 on title validation failure, 404 on cross-workspace source lookup.
- Service flow: BEGIN → `SELECT * FROM atcs WHERE id = $source*id AND workspace*id = $session.workspace*id` (404 if not found) → compute `new*title = $new*title ?? (source.title || ' (copy)')` → validate `new*title` length 3..200 → INSERT new atcs row inheriting `module*id, user*story*id, acceptance*criterion*ids, layer, tags`, `version = 1`, `slug = compute*slug(new*atc*id, module*id)` → INSERT atc*steps from `SELECT position, content, input*data, expected FROM atc*steps WHERE atc*id = $source*id` → INSERT atc*assertions from `SELECT position, content FROM atc*assertions WHERE atc*id = $source*id` → COMMIT.
- Event emission: `atc.created` (NOT `atc.duplicated`) with the full new ATC payload. Downstream consumers (search index, etc.) need no special handling — duplicate looks like a normal create.
- Slug is freshly computed from the new atc_id. Slugs are never cloned.
- No FK link between source and duplicate after creation — they are fully independent rows. Edits to one do not propagate to the other.
- No re-validation of cross-entity rules (AC↔US, module↔project subtree) — the source already passed those rules at its creation time. If the source's relationships have become invalid since (rare, only via admin operations), this is acknowledged as out-of-scope cleanup.

## Dependencies
- Upstream: ***BK-18 (FR-010a)*** — reuses the insert path, slug computation, and event emission. Strongly prefer landing BK-18 first and extracting an internal `createAtc(payload)` service function that this story calls.
- Downstream: ATC list/detail UI gets a "Duplicate" action that calls this endpoint and redirects to the new ATC's detail page.
- External: same event bus as BK-18.

## Definition of Done (expanded)
- [ ] OpenAPI entry for `POST /atcs/{source_id}/duplicate` with optional body and response shape
- [ ] `bun run api:sync` passes
- [ ] Unit tests: default title with `(copy)` suffix, custom new_title overrides, title-too-short rejection, viewer-role rejection, multi-position assertions copied correctly
- [ ] Integration test: edit the duplicate, verify source is unchanged (independence guarantee)
- [ ] Integration test: emitted event is `atc.created` with full payload (not a separate event type)
- [ ] Lint + typecheck pass
- [ ] Manual smoke: duplicate an ATC via curl, verify steps and assertions counts match source
- [ ] PR description references each AC by Gherkin scenario name
