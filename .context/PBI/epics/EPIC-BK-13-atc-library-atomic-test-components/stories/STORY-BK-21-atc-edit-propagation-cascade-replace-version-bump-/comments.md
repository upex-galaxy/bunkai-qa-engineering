# 🧱 Architect Annotation

## Technical Notes
- DB tables touched: `atcs` (UPDATE + version increment), `atc*steps`/`atc*assertions` (cascade replace within transaction), READ from `test*steps` to compute `affected*test*ids`. Existing index on `test*steps(atc_id)` is required — verify or add.
- API surface: extends `PATCH /atcs/{id}` from BK-18. Adds `If-Match: <version>` header support for optimistic concurrency. Returns 200 `{ atc, version, affected*test*count }` plus `affected*test*ids` in the emitted event payload.
- Transaction shape: BEGIN → `SELECT ... FROM atcs WHERE id = $1 FOR UPDATE` → check `If-Match` version matches → validate cross-entity rules (reuse BK-18 logic) → if layer changed, run policy check against referencing Tests → UPDATE atcs SET ... , version = version + 1 → DELETE FROM atc*steps WHERE atc*id = $1 → DELETE FROM atc*assertions WHERE atc*id = $1 → INSERT new steps/assertions → SELECT array*agg(test*id) FROM test*steps WHERE atc*id = $1 → COMMIT.
- Propagation guarantee: Tests reference ATCs by `atc*id` in `test*steps`. Step content is NEVER copied into `test_steps` at composition time. This is the architectural invariant that makes propagation automatic.
- Event emission: `atc.updated` published after commit with `{ atc*id, version, affected*test_ids[] }`. Consumers (notifications, search index refresh, etc.) subscribe.
- Layer-policy check: query `SELECT t.id, t.layer*policy FROM tests t JOIN test*steps ts ON ts.test*id = t.id WHERE ts.atc*id = $1 AND $new*layer NOT MATCHING t.layer*policy`. If any rows return, abort with 422.
- Role check uses existing session helper; minimum role is `member`.

## Dependencies
- Upstream: ***BK-18 (FR-010a)*** — this story extends the PATCH endpoint defined there. The base validation, transaction shape, and event bus integration come from BK-18.
- Upstream: EPIC-BK-5 must define the `test*steps(atc*id)` foreign key and any layer-policy column on `tests` before propagation can be tested end-to-end.
- Downstream: Notifications epic (out-of-scope) will subscribe to `atc.updated` to email affected Test authors. Search index refresh (BK-20) listens to the same event to update `search_tsv` if title/tags changed.
- External: event bus (same as BK-18).

## Definition of Done (expanded)
- [ ] PATCH endpoint accepts `If-Match` header and returns 409 on mismatch
- [ ] `affected*test*ids` computed inside the same transaction (read consistency)
- [ ] Event payload includes `affected*test*ids[]` — schema documented in `.context/business/events.md`
- [ ] Integration test: edit an ATC and verify a referencing Test sees the change on next GET WITHOUT any test_steps row being modified
- [ ] Integration test: layer change rejected when referencing Test has incompatible policy
- [ ] Unit tests for version skew (409) and insufficient role (403)
- [ ] OpenAPI updated for `If-Match` header and new error codes (`version*conflict`, `layer*breaks*test*policy`)
- [ ] `bun run api:sync` passes
- [ ] PR description references each AC by Gherkin scenario name
