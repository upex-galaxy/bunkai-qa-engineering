🧱 ****Architect Annotation****

**Posted by repo automation. Sections below are the architecture-grade complement to the user-facing fields (description / AC / Scope / Business Rules / Workflow). Source-of-truth on dev-side concerns — synced to local `comments.md` by `sync-jira-issues`.**

1. 

- Component: `<WorkspaceSwitcher />` in `app/layout.tsx` header.
- Hook: `useActiveWorkspace()` consuming `AuthContext`.

1. 

- Routes:
- `GET app/api/v1/me/workspaces/route.ts`
- `POST app/api/v1/me/active-workspace/route.ts`
- Middleware updated to read `active*workspace*id` from session on every request.

1. 

- Tables: `workspace_members` (status field).
- Session: stored in Supabase cookie + read by `lib/supabase/server.ts`.

1. 

- [https://jira.upexgalaxy.com/browse/BK-4#icft=BK-4](https://jira.upexgalaxy.com/browse/BK-4#icft=BK-4) (workspace creation) — need ≥2 workspaces to switch between.

1. 

- API middleware tenancy scoping (relied upon by every subsequent epic).

1. 

- [ ] All 4 AC scenarios pass on staging.
- [ ] API middleware verified — every protected route reads active*workspace*id.
- [ ] UI switcher renders correctly when user has 1, 2, and 10+ workspaces.
- [ ] Suspended-membership path returns 403 (not 404 / not silent success).

Implementado este sprint.

Code on main:

- f0d36d0 feat(workspaces): active-workspace switch via cookie + /me introspection (bk-6)

Surfaces ready for QA:

- GET /api/v1/me — returns user + workspaces[] + active*workspace*id (resolved from bk*active*ws cookie; falls back to oldest workspace).
- POST /api/v1/me/active-workspace — membership-validated workspace selection; sets httpOnly cookie bk*active*ws (sameSite=lax, 90d).
- WorkspaceSwitcher (Topbar dropdown) fetches /api/v1/me lazily, calls switch endpoint on selection, router.refresh on success. Footer link to members page.

Cross-tenant guard: RLS continues to filter every query; switching the cookie does not grant access — only narrows the active scope in the UI. Verify by signing in as a second user and querying the first user's workspace_id directly — expect 0 rows.

Testability guide: /qa + Jira Epic [https://jira.upexgalaxy.com/browse/BK-29#icft=BK-29](https://jira.upexgalaxy.com/browse/BK-29#icft=BK-29).
